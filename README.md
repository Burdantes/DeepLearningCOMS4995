#  DeepLearning COMS4995 - Comparative Analysis of Recommender Systems: Impact on Bias and Polarization

### Data
In the Data folder, we have integrated a few of the dataset that we consider as part of this project. We mainly focus on ML1M Dataset for now and will extend later when we found other datasets with user level information.

### Collaborative Filtering and Vanilla Matrix Completion 

We have written a Jupyter Notebook that illustrates some statistics and implement both the vanilla matrix completion and Collaborative Filtering from *ML1M_Dataset.ipynb*. 

### GNN Recommender (work in progress)

We are working on implementing a GNN architecture. The main architecture we will consider in question can be found in Github (https://github.com/xiangwang1223/neural_graph_collaborative_filtering) and will be updated to satisfy our dataset.

### Transformer (work in progress)

### Outputs 

We save our output in Outputs for the different architecture
